# Cross-Chain Minting Demo

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of utilizing the RIP-7755 protocol to facilitate cross-chain communication for the purpose of minting NFTs. It showcases the process of sending a cross-chain message from one blockchain to another, enabling users to initiate an NFT minting transaction on a destination chain by paying on a source chain.
